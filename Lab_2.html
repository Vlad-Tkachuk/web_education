          <strong>C#</strong> (pronounced see sharp) is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. C# encompasses
           static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented
            (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.
         
        </p>

        <p>
            The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved
             as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Microsoft introduced
              C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no
               open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a
                cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft
                 released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework),
                  all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was
                   not merged into .NET.

                During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a managed code compiler 
                system called "Simple Managed C" (SMC).[20][21] In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed a team to build a new language
                at the time called Cool, which stood for "C-like Object Oriented Language".[22] Microsoft had considered keeping the name
                "Cool" as the final name of the language, but chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly
                announced at the July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries and
                ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.

                Hejlsberg is C#'s principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft, and was previously involved with the design of
                Turbo Pascal, Embarcadero Delphi (formerly CodeGear Delphi, Inprise Delphi and Borland Delphi), and Visual J++.
                In interviews and technical papers he has stated that flaws[23] in most major programming languages 
                (e.g. C++, Java, Delphi, and Smalltalk) drove the fundamentals of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which, in turn,
                drove the design of the C# language itself.

                James Gosling, who created the Java programming language in 1994, and Bill Joy, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems,
                the originator of Java, called C# an "imitation" of Java; Gosling further said that "[C# is] sort of Java with 
                reliability, productivity and security deleted."[24][25] Klaus Kreft and Angelika Langer (authors of a C++ streams book)
                stated in a blog post that "Java and C# are almost identical programming languages. Boring repetition that lacks
                innovation,"[26] "Hardly anybody will claim that Java or C# are revolutionary programming languages that changed
                the way we write programs," and "C# borrowed a lot from Java - and vice versa. Now that C# supports boxing and
                unboxing, we'll have a very similar feature in Java."[27] In July 2000, Hejlsberg said that C# is "not a Java clone"
                and is "much closer to C++" in its design.[28]
